# pragmatic_data_practice
__data practitioner's handbook__

Working with data became in recent years a normal part of life for lots of people. At the same time, it might be difficult to find some bite-sized tips for day-to-day work to improve practices we use that could help us work more efficiently, save time and mitigate some stress. This handbook intends to provide a collection of practical tips for working with data in general, not focused to a particular technology or programing language. 

### Motivation
I never was into programming. I studied plant physiology, earned a PhD and started out a reasearch career. At one point, as I finally collected enough data from an experiment I was really excited about, I realized that I might not have the ability to process and analyze the collected data in the way I wanted to. But I was dedicated and decided I will it in some way in Excel, using some simple functions and solid copy-pasting skills. 

After four days I was ready and the results were interesting. I needed to do more experiments, I wanted to understand it better. But then I realized how long it took to process three different variants and now I would need to do 12. So either I will bother somebody to do it for me and wait for weeks till they get some available bandwidth or I will learn how to do it myself. Without any prior programming knowledge, I spent the next 20 hours trying to open a .csv file in R-studio. I did not manage to do so, felt stupid and helpless and almost started crying. Well, I think I did cry in the end. 

Six years later, I work as a data engineer, somehow becoming a go-to person to discuss practices, design solutions and analyze data. I love it and I strive to get better, be more efficient and extract meaningful information. I love helping people build robust solutions to their problems and learn something new along the way work. 

One thing that helped me is to follow some simple practices, collect and continuously improve useful snippets of code or some code templates and then play with it, combine it, experiment. My motivation here is to share what I have learned and eventually grow the collection with more pragmatic tips and tricks.
